        <p style="padding-top: 10px;">In addition, ELITE ITT provides Vietnamese cultural consultation and run workshops on working with interpreters (See Presentations under Research). As regards our interpreting and translation students, we train, we use. The best students from our interpreting and translation courses, after passing the NAATI Level 3 / Professional interpreting tests, will be trained further and used by us. Our training and accordingly your progress go beyond the NAATI Level 3 tests and continue thereafter until you are ready to be selected for work by ELITE ITT.</p>
        <h2>Why study at ELITE ITT?</h2>
        <p style="padding-top:10px;"><b>For the NAATI CCL & Certification tests:</b></p>
        <p> With reference to NAATI CCL and Certification test training, we all know that if you learn from a good interpreter, translator and teacher, chances are you will interpret or translate well. Otherwise, there is no chance you can be good at interpreting or translating. The following list helps you identify a good CCL and interpreting & translating certification teacher.</p>
        <p><i>1)   Teaching qualifications:</i></p>
        <p> They need to be qualified as a teacher. No matter what they say, being a NAATI interpreter is not enough to teach interpreting. Good teaching requires a high level of formal education, practical experience, talent, etc.</p>
        <p><i>2)   NAATI professional level accreditation:</i></p>
        <p>If a trained teacher is not a good, professional interpreter or not even a NAATI professional one, that one cannot be a good interpreting teacher. You cannot teach what you cannot do. </p>
        <p>Similarly, if a teacher is not a NAATI professional translator in the language direction you are studying, they are not in the position to teach you that subject. </p>
        <p><i>3)   NAATI interpreting AND translating accreditation:</i></p>
        <p>They should be both a professional interpreter AND a professional translator in BOTH language directions. A professional interpreter without translating accreditation in both language directions cannot compare to the one who has all three.</p>
        <p><i>4)  Experience:</i></p>
        <p>Check when they obtained their NAATI accreditation / certification at the professional level. Accredited interpreters and translators are, for the most part, more experienced than certified ones because you can be sure that they obtained their accreditation before 2007.</p>
        <p><i>5) Research and good standing in the field:</i></p>
        <p>Teaching and research go hand in hand. Check their research profile and see what they have done for the profession.</p>
        <p>The list goes on but you should have a good idea by now whom to entrust with training you for the CCL or Certification test.</p>

        <p><b>For the TOEFL iBT, IELTS, PTE Academic, OET & CAE Tests:</b></p>
        <p>1)      We have <i>been there, done that.</i></p>
        <p>The Principal Teacher _ Dr Giao Quynh Tran _ achieved the top TOEFL score, which helped win her a scholarship for her MA studies in the U.S. So she, together with ELITE ITT, knows very well how to help students, especially Vietnamese ones, do well in the English tests.</p>
        <p><i>2)      Teaching qualifications and experience in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL)</i></p>
        <p>The Principal Teacher _ Dr Giao Quynh Tran _ is highly qualified (See below) and has four years of experience teaching English (TESOL) as a staff member in the Department of English Linguistics and Literature, School of Social Sciences and Humanities at Vietnam National University, and several periods of teaching English as a Second Language (ESL) as well as tutoring in postgraduate Linguistics and Applied Linguistics programs in Vietnam, USA and Australia</p>
