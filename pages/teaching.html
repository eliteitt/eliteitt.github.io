        <p style="padding-top: 10px;">In addition, ELITE ITT provides Vietnamese cultural consultation and run workshops on working with interpreters (See Presentations under Research). As regards our interpreting and translation students, we train, we use. The best students from our interpreting and translation courses, after passing the NAATI Level 3 / Professional interpreting tests, will be trained further and used by us. Our training and accordingly your progress go beyond the NAATI Level 3 tests and continue thereafter until you are ready to be selected for work by ELITE ITT.</p>
        <h2>Why study at ELITE ITT?</h2>
        <p style="padding-top:10px;">With reference to English test training, Dr Tran achieved the top TOEFL score, which helped win her a scholarship for her MA studies in the U.S. So she, together with ELITE ITT, knows very well how to help students, especially Vietnamese ones, do well in the English tests.</p>
        <p>In terms of NAATI CCL and Certification test training, we all know that if you learn from a good interpreter and teacher, chances are you will interpret well. But if your teacher is not a good interpreter or not even a NAATI professional one, there is no way you can be good at interpreting.</p>
        <p>At ELITE ITT, you have the opportunity to study under Dr Giao Quynh Tran - Founder and Principal Interpreter, Translator and Teacher at ELITE ITT, who has a strong academic background and substantial practical experience in language teaching, TESOL, linguistics, applied linguistics, interpreting, translation, interpreting and translation teaching, and NAATI CCL as well as Certification test training.</p>
        <p>In the academia, Dr Tran has a PhD in Applied Linguistics (UniMelb), an MA in English (UW Madison, WI, USA), a Graduate Diploma in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages - TESOL (Canberra University), a Graduate Certificate in TESOL (UW Madison, WI, USA) and a BA in English (VNU). She is also a NAATI Level 3 / Professional Interpreter and Translator in English and Vietnamese, both directions. She has more than a decade of experience teaching at tertiary level and in the private sector in Vietnam, the U.S. and Australia, having taught postgraduate interpreting and translation in English and Vietnamese, both directions, and having supervised MA theses in TESOL at Western Sydney University. She has been well-regarded by her students wherever she has taught and at ELITE ITT.</p>
        <p>In the industry, Dr Tran is an established Vietnamese interpreter and translator. She was praised for her expertise by attendants at her <a href="http://ausit.org/AUSIT/Eflash/170610_Court_Interpreting_Workshop.html" target="_blank">AUSIT Court Interpreting workshop</a>. She also received very positive feedback on her <a href="https://lsj.com.au/articles/interpreters-and-lawyers-why-we-must-work-together-for-better-outcomes/" target="_blank">article on court interpreting</a> in the Australian Law Society Journal. In addition, she gave a <a href="https://benchtv.com.au/presenter/dr-giao-quynh-tran-dr-grace-tran/" target="_blank">presentation on legal interpreting</a> by invitation on Bench TV.</p>
        <p>A good teacher is also a strong researcher. Dr Tran has carried out fruitful research projects resulting in peer â€“ reviewed publications in and presentations on Applied Linguistics, TESOL and Court Interpreting. Her Naturalized Role-play, which she created for her <a href="https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/3885126?lookfor=giao%20quynh%20tran&offset=1&max=1" target="_blank">PhD research</a>, won her the Solidarity Award from the American Association for Applied Linguistics (AAAL) at the 2004 AAAL Conference. Based on peer review, she is doing a great job supervising MA theses in TESOL at Western Sydney University.</p>
        <p>Therefore, with Dr Tran being the lead teacher, there is no doubt about the teaching quality at ELITE ITT. Here students have the opportunity to learn from the elite in the interpreting, translation and language teaching professions.</p>
        <p>If you speak both English and Vietnamese and have pondered becoming an interpreter or translator, or if you are planning to take the NAATI CCL / Naati Certification / TOEFL iBT / IELTS / PTE Academic / OET / CAE test, do not wait any longer. Enroll at ELITE ITT today.</p>
