        <h1>Interpreting, Translation &amp; English Teaching AND NAATI Certification, NAATI, CCL, IELTS, TOEFL iBT, PTE Academic, OET &amp; CAE Test Training</h1>
        <img src="../images/training.jpg" width="30%" height="30%" />
    <p>As an interpreting, translation and language academy, we pride ourselves in our unrivalled teaching, especially in Dr Giao Quynh Tran's effective and creative
teaching, which has been highly evaluated by her students for over decades. Our lessons have been considered the most helpful by our students.</p>

<p>We specialise in teaching and training candidates for the NAATI CCL (for 5 bonus points towards their Australian immigration visa applications), CLA (for the
public and private sectors to determine eligibility for language allowances), Level 2 (paraprofessional / certified provisional) interpreting, Level 3 (professional /
certified) interpreting and translation tests in English and Vietnamese, both language directions; and the IELTS, TOEFL iBT, PTE Academic, OET, CAE tests.
Our areas of expertise also include teaching legal, police, medical and community interpreting and translation; dialogue, consecutive and simultaneous
interpreting; general, communicative and academic English as well as Vietnamese.</p>

<p>Moreover, we provide Vietnamese cultural consultation and run workshops on working with interpreters (See Presentations under <a href="Research.html">Research</a>). As regards our interpreting and translation students, we train, we use. The best students from our interpreting and translation courses, after passing the NAATI Level 3/Professional interpreting tests, will be trained further and used by us. Our
training and accordingly your progress go beyond the NAATI Level 3 tests and continue thereafter until you are ready to be selected for work by ELITE ITT.</p>

<p>The Principal Teacher, Dr Giao (Grace) Quynh Tran _ Founder and Principal Interpreter, Translator and Teacher at ELITE ITT _ has a strong academic
background and extensive experience in teaching. She achieved the top TOEFL score, which helped win her a scholarship for her MA studies in the U.S. She also
has many years of experience in teaching at tertiary level in Vietnam, the U.S. and Australia. Her dedication to and creativity in teaching have made her a
prominent teacher in postgraduate interpreting and translation programs in the Vietnamese and English languages as well as an impressive supervisor of MA
theses in TESOL at Western Sydney University. Furthermore, she has made a name for herself as a highly evaluated teacher at ELITE ITT.</p>

<p>Dr Tran was praised for her expertise by attendants at her <a href="http://ausit.org/AUSIT/Eflash/170610_Court_Interpreting_Workshop.html" target="_blank">AUSIT Court Interpreting workshop</a>. She also received very positive feedback on <a href="https://lsj.com.au/articles/interpreters-and-lawyers-why-we-must-work-together-for-better-outcomes/" target="_blank">her article on court interpreting in the Australian Law Society Journal</a>. In addition, she gave <a href="https://benchtv.com.au/presenter/dr-giao-quynh-tran-dr-grace-tran/" target="_blank">a presentation on legal interpreting by invitation on Bench TV</a>.</p>

<p>A good teacher is also a strong researcher. Dr Tran has carried out a lot of fruitful research projects resulting in publications in Applied Linguistics, TESOL
and Court Interpreting. With her Nationalized Role-play _ an innovative research methodology that she created for her PhD research, she was one of the three
researchers worldwide to win the Solidarity Award from the American Association for Applied Linguistics (AAAL) at the 2004 AAAL Conference. Based on peer
review, she is doing a great job supervising MA theses in TESOL at Western Sydney University.</p>

<p>With Dr Tran being the lead teacher, there is no doubt about the teaching quality at ELITE ITT. Here students have the opportunity to learn from the elite in the
interpreting, translation and language teaching professions.</p>
