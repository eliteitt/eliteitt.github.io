        <p style="padding-top: 10px;">In addition, ELITE ITT provides Vietnamese cultural consultation and run workshops on working with interpreters (See Presentations under Research). As regards our interpreting and translation students, we train, we use. The best students from our interpreting and translation courses, after passing the NAATI Level 3 / Professional interpreting tests, will be trained further and used by us. Our training and accordingly your progress go beyond the NAATI Level 3 tests and continue thereafter until you are ready to be selected for work by ELITE ITT.</p>
        <h2>Why study at ELITE ITT?</h2>
        <p style="padding-top:10px;"><b>For the NAATI CCL & Certification tests:</b></p>
        <p> With reference to NAATI CCL and Certification test training, we all know that if you learn from a good interpreter, translator and teacher, chances are you will interpret or translate well. Otherwise, there is no chance you can be good at interpreting or translating. The following list helps you identify a good CCL and interpreting & translating certification teacher.</p>
        <p><i>1)   Teaching qualifications:</i></p>
        <p> Your teacher, first and foremost, needs to be qualified as a teacher. Being a NAATI interpreter is not enough to teach interpreting. Good teaching requires a high level of formal education, practical experience, talent, etc.</p>
        <p>At ELITE ITT, you will study with Dr Giao Quynh Tran - a highly qualified teacher.
        <ul><li>PhD in Applied Linguistics from the University of Melbourne</li>
            <li>MA in English from University of Wisconsin, USA</li>
            <li>Graduate Diploma in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) from Canberra University</li>
            <li>Graduate Certificate in TESOL from University of Wisconsin, USA</li>
            <li>NAATI Accredited Professional Interpreter and Translator in English and Vietnamese, both directions</li>
        </ul>     
        </p>
        <p><i>2)  Teaching experience:</i></p>
        <p>In the academia,  our Principal Teacher - Dr Giao Quynh Tran - has more than a decade of experience teaching at tertiary level and in the private sector in Vietnam, the U.S. and Australia, having taught postgraduate interpreting and translation in English and Vietnamese, both directions, and having supervised MA theses in TESOL at Western Sydney University. She has been well-regarded by her students wherever she has taught and at ELITE ITT.</p>
        <p><i>3)   NAATI professional level accreditation:</i></p>
        <p> If a trained teacher is not a good, professional interpreter or not even a NAATI professional one, that one cannot be a good interpreting teacher. You cannot teach what you cannot do.</p>
        <p>Similarly, if a teacher is not a NAATI professional translator in the language direction you are studying, they are not in the position to teach you that subject.</p>
        <p>Dr Giao Quynh Tran is a NAATI Accredited Professional Interpreter and Translator in English and Vietnamese, both language directions.</p>
        <p><i>4) NAATI interpreting AND translating accreditation:</i></p>
        <p>Your teacher should be both a professional interpreter AND a professional translator in BOTH language directions. A professional interpreter without translating accreditation in both language directions cannot compare to the one who has all three.</p>
        <p>Dr Giao Quynh Tran at ELITE ITT has all three types of NAATI Accreditation as a:
            <ul> <li>Professional Interpreter in the English and Vietnamese languages</li>
            <ul> <li>Professional Translator from English into Vietnamese</li>
            <ul> <li>Professional Translator from Vietnamese into English</li>
            </ul></p>
        <p><i>5) Interpreting and translating experience:</i></p>
        <p>Check when your teacher obtained their NAATI accreditation / certification at the professional level. Accredited interpreters and translators are, for the most part, more experienced than certified ones because you can be sure that accredited ones became professionals before 2007.</p>
        <p>Dr Giao Quynh Tran is a NAATI Accredited Interpreter and Translator in English and Vietnamese, both directions. Her NAATI accreditation certificates are shown in the featured video on ELITE ITTâ€™s YouTube channel on our website.</p>
        <p>In the industry, Dr Tran is an established Vietnamese interpreter and translator with more than twenty five years of international interpreting and translating experience including fifteen years of experience as a professional Interpreter and Translator in English and Vietnamese, both directions, in Australia. She is substantially experienced in Legal Interpreting, Medical Interpreting, Simultaneous / Conference Interpreting, Phone Interpreting and Translation. </p>
        <p><i>6) Research and good standing in the field:</i></p>
        <p>Teaching and research go hand in hand. Check your teacherâ€™s research profile to see what they have done for the profession.</p>
        <p>Dr Giao Quynh Tran is a strong researcher. She has carried out fruitful research projects resulting in peer â€“ reviewed publications and presentations. Her Naturalized Role-play, which she created for her PhD research, won her the Solidarity Award from the American Association for Applied Linguistics (AAAL) at the 2004 AAAL Conference. Based on peer review, she is doing a great job supervising MA theses in TESOL at Western Sydney University.</p>
        <p><i>7) Being both a good interpreter & translator AND a good teacher:</i></p>
        <p>One needs to be both a good interpreter & translator AND a good teacher to teach interpreting and/or translation well.</p>
        <p>Dr Giao Quynh Tran has received a lot of truthful compliments on her interpreting & translating expertise AND on her teaching quality. Moreover, Dr Tran was praised for her expertise by attendants at her AUSIT Court Interpreting workshop. She also received very positive feedback on her article on court interpreting in the Australian Law Society Journal. In addition, she gave a presentation on legal interpretingby invitation on Bench TV.</p>
        <p><i>8) Passion for the profession:</i></p>
        <p>Good professionals are passionate about their work but not all passionate people are good at their profession.</p>
        <p>Dr Giao Quynh Tranâ€™s passion is in teaching, interpreting, translating and research. She is driven to help others with what she is endowed with; and that is best done through her English, interpreting and translating teaching as well as research. After all, without passion, it would have been hard to do all that she has been doing. </p>
        <p><i>9) Talent:</i></p>
        <p>To be at the top of any profession, you need not only hard work but also talent. Talent needs formal training to develop but talent sets you apart from the rest.</p>
        <p>Become a student of Dr Giao Quynh Tran and you will be able to tell by yourself if she is a great teacher.</p>
