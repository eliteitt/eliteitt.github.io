            <p>Dr (Grace) Giao Quynh Tran is the best interpreter in all of the years I have worked at the
courts. And that's 19 years.</p>

            <p>Elite ITT's courses are very good, making a practical contribution to the community and
creating good work opportunities for students. Dr Giao Quynh Tran is a gifted and the best
Vietnamese interpreter / translator in Australia. I have known Dr Tran for about 7 years, and
I know very well her oustanding ability in interpreting, translation and teaching as well as
her exceptional interpreting, translating and teaching skills. I am certain that Dr Tran's Elite
ITT is the best in the industry.</p>

            <h3>********</h3>
            <p>During 25 years working in Vietnamese-Australian media, we have had the opportunities to
interview Australian politicians in many areas from state to federal governments. On a
number of occasions Federal politicians needed an interpreter in press conferences in both
the Vietnamese and English languages. I listened to Dr Giao Tran's interpreting. Her
interpreting style is characterized by her precise wording and clarity, making many listeners
have the impression that the speakers were Vietnamese native speakers rather than
foreigners. Therefore, her interpreting helps the speakers win the listeners' favour. In my
opinion, the interpreter in that circumstance played a very successful role. Specially Dr Tran
always fulfills her duties and responsibilities.</p>

            <h3>********</h3>
            <p>Elite ITT's courses are very useful for beginners who would like to become Level 2
interpreters and for Level 2 interpreters who would like to upgrade to Level 3. Dr Giao
Quynh Tran is not only a successful NAATI Level 3 interpreter but also a PhD. She's both
talented and nice.</p>
<p>Moreover, she has a Linguistic background so she interprets very competently. Interpreters
from other professional backgrounds and without formal training in Linguistics can hardly
do so. Having listened to her interpreting, I reckon that she interprets very accurately and
that she is a very reliable interpreter.</p>
<p>On many occasions different colleagues, who were not aware that I knew Giao, told me that
they met in court a lady interpreter who is young but interprets so beautifully. That's Giao.
So indeed, she is a well-known interpreter and is at the top of this profession. Her teaching is
surely high quality teaching.</p>
