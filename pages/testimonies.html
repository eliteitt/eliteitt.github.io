            <h1>Testimonials</h1>

            <p>Dr (Grace) Giao Quynh Tran is the best interpreter in all of the years I have worked at the
courts. And that's 19 years.</p>

            <p>Absolutely helpful! Dr Giao (Grace) Tran pointed out my weaknesses and helped me get through them. My interpreting skills improved so much after a 10 hour one-on-one tutorial and I was able to pass my CCL Naati test thanks to Dr Grace Tran's lessons. Thank you very much! 5 stars!

Prior to training at ELITE ITT, Nikki trained elsewhere for a rather long time but she failed the test twice without knowing why. <br> After training in a one-on-one class with Dr Giao Tran at ELITE  ITT for only 10 hours, she passed the CCL test to gain 5 immigration bonus points at the first attempt.</h2>

            <h3>********</h3>
            <p>It is very lucky for me to learn from Dr Giao Tran. She is a professional tutor with many years of experience in teaching. I have gained a lot of things after learning from her. The material of the course is useful. Thank you Dr Giao Tran.</p>

She passed the test to become a NAATI Level 3 / Professional Vietnamese-to-English Translator <br> after studying under Dr Grace Giao (Grace) Tran of ELITE ITT in a one-on-one class for a number of months</h2>

            <h3>********</h3>
            <p>ELITE ITT's courses are very good, making a practical contribution to the community and
creating good work opportunities for students. Dr Giao Quynh Tran is a gifted and the best
Vietnamese interpreter / translator in Australia. I have known Dr Tran for about 7 years, and
I know very well her oustanding ability in interpreting, translation and teaching as well as
her exceptional interpreting, translating and teaching skills. I am certain that Dr Tran's Elite
ITT is the best in the industry.</p>

            <h3>********</h3>
            <p>ELITE ITT's courses are very useful for beginners who would like to become Level 2
interpreters and for Level 2 interpreters who would like to upgrade to Level 3. Dr Giao
Quynh Tran is not only a successful NAATI Level 3 interpreter but also a PhD. She's both
talented and nice.</p>
<p>Moreover, she has a Linguistic background so she interprets very competently. Interpreters
from other professional backgrounds and without formal training in Linguistics can hardly
do so. Having listened to her interpreting, I reckon that she interprets very accurately and
that she is a very reliable interpreter.</p>
<p>On many occasions different colleagues, who were not aware that I knew Giao, told me that
they met in court a lady interpreter who is young but interprets so beautifully. That's Giao.
So indeed, she is a well-known interpreter and is at the top of this profession. Her teaching is
surely high quality teaching.</p>

            <h3>********</h3>
            <p>During 25 years working in Vietnamese-Australian media, we have had the opportunities to
interview Australian politicians in many areas from state to federal governments. On a
number of occasions Federal politicians needed an interpreter in press conferences in both
the Vietnamese and English languages. I listened to Dr Giao Tran's interpreting. Her
interpreting style is characterized by her precise wording and clarity, making many listeners
have the impression that the speakers were Vietnamese native speakers rather than
foreigners. Therefore, her interpreting helps the speakers win the listeners' favour. In my
opinion, the interpreter in that circumstance played a very successful role. Specially Dr Tran
always fulfills her duties and responsibilities.</p>

            <p>Excellent service. ELITE ITT has helped me in translating some Vietnamese documents into English with NAATI-accredited translations. Personally, I found ELITE ITT provided excellent translating service with timely response and reasonable cost compared to other sites. I definitely recommend my friends to see ELITE ITT when they need any documents translated.<br> Ratings:<br> 5 stars out of 5 for Quality<br>5 stars out of 5 for Reliability<br>5 stars out of 5 for Friendliness</p>
