            <h1>Legal Interpreting</h1>
            <img src="../images/legal.jpg" width="32%"  />
            <p>When working with non-English speaking clients in legal processes, it is essential to secure the service of the best interpreter in the respective language because <i>everything you have </i>to build your case upon comes from the interpreter. A good interpreter gives you <i>accuracy</i>, which is to your advantage, whereas a bad interpreter can destroy your case. Unfortunately, when you have free interpreters provided by courts, you do not get to choose them. Even if you do, the best one does not work for agencies affiliated with courts.</p>
 
<p>Bear in mind that top interpreters in each language are usually neither old ones nor newbies. Good interpreting requires accuracy, speed, concentration, short term memory, stamina, etc. All of these qualities deteriorate with age. Young ones, or newly certified ones at any age, however, lack experience, which matters in any profession. We are certainly not among newbies. Nor are we among old ones who may be losing out on what it takes to be good at this job. Given the aforementioned qualities required for good interpreting, this is not a profession for retirees or novices.</p>
 
            <p>The Principal Interpreter _ Dr Giao Quynh Tran (Dr Grace Tran) has decades of experience to ensure the quality of legal interpreting provided by ELITE ITT. She has frequently interpreted at various Local Courts in NSW, NSW District Courts in Sydney and Parramatta, Supreme Courts, Federal Court, Family Court, Children's Courts in Parramatta and Glebe, Administrative Appeals Tribunal including Migration and Refugee Devision, NSW Police, AFP, etc. Previously she provided frequent interpreting services to the Magistrates' Court, County Court, Supreme Court, Federal Court, Migration Review Tribunal, Refugee Review Tribunal, VIC Police, AFP, etc. in Melbourne. Legal professionals whom she has worked with have unanimously complimented her on her accuracy in Court / Legal Interpreting. She has checked transcripts of recorded interviews as well as intercepted calls and has written helpful expert witness reports. She has also appeared as an expert witness at NSW District Court in Sydney.</p>

<p>Dr Tran was praised for her expertise by attendants at her <a href="http://ausit.org/AUSIT/Eflash/170610_Court_Interpreting_Workshop.html" target="_blank">AUSIT Court Interpreting workshop</a>. She also received very positive feedback on <a href="https://lsj.com.au/articles/interpreters-and-lawyers-why-we-must-work-together-for-better-outcomes/" target="_blank">her article on court interpreting in the Australian Law Society Journal</a>. In addition, she gave <a href="https://benchtv.com.au/presenter/dr-giao-quynh-tran-dr-grace-tran/" target="_blank">a presentation on legal interpreting by invitation on Bench TV</a>.</p>
