        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p> ELITE Interpreters, Translators &amp; Teachers (ELITE ITT) is both a language service provider and a language academy. As such, ELITE ITT's specialization is two-fold: providing interpreting, translation and consultation services as well as teaching interpreting, translation and languages, namely English and Vietnamese, for the NAATI Certification, CCL, TOEFL iBT, IELTS, PTE Academic, OET, CAE tests and for professional development purposes.</p> 

<p>As regards interpreting and translation, nothing could be further from the truth than the assumption that all interpreters (who work with spoken language) / translators (who work with written language) are the same. There is a significant difference in quality between a so-so interpreter's / translator's and a good one's performance.</p>

<p>At Elite ITT, we pride ourselves on our technically and artistically advanced interpreting and translating skills. With our combination of academic qualifications, practical experience, work ethics and expertise, we will most effectively help you overcome any barriers to cross-linguistic and cross-cultural communication.</p>
<P>With reference to teaching, it goes without saying that a good teacher is hard to find. Simply being a NAATI interpreter / translator does not make one a good teacher of interpreting / translation. Good teaching requires a high level of formal education, a lot of practical experience, talent, etc. However, if a trained teacher is not a good, professional interpreter, that one cannot be a good interpreting teacher either. You cannot teach what you cannot do. Reality is that most interpreters and translators are not qualified to teach while most teachers are not qualified to both interpret and translate, not to mention be superb in these realms.</p>

<p>As this combination is rare, we are confident that when it comes to teaching interpreting and translation in English and Vietnamese, both directions, for the NAATI Certification and CCL tests as well as for professional development purposes, we do not compete. We dominate. We also have every confidence in our effective language teaching and training for English tests including but not limited to the TOELF iBT, IELTS, PTE Academic, OET, CAE tests, and for other professional pursuits</p> 

<p>It is said that specialization usually does not occur until PhD level. Let us introduce you to the Founder of ELITE ITT, who created it to meet the lasting demand for good interpreters, translators and teachers.</p>
