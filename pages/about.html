        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p> Nothing could be further from the truth than the assumption that all interpreters (who
work with spoken language) / translators (who work with written language) are the
same. There is a significant difference in quality between a so-so interpreter's / translator's and a good one's performance.</p>
<p>At Elite ITT, we pride ourselves on our technically and artistically advanced
interpreting, translating as well as teaching. With our combination of academic
qualifications, practical experience and expertise, we will most effectively help you
overcome any barriers to cross-linguistic and cross-cultural communication.</p>
        <h2>Dr Giao (Grace) Quynh Tran</h2>
        <h3> Founder<br>
        Principal Interpreter, Translator &amp; Teacher</h3>
        <p>Dr Tran has a PhD in Applied Linguistics from the University of Melbourne, an MA
in English (Applied Linguistics) and a Graduate Certificate in Teaching English to
Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) from University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI,
USA, a Graduate Diploma in TESOL from Canberra University and a BA in English
from Vietnam National University. She is also a NAATI Professional Interpreter and Translator in English and Vietnamese, both directions.</p>
        <p> As an interpreter / translator, Dr Tran has a lot of experience in legal, medical and
community interpreting / translating as well as in simultaneous / conference
interpreting. She has been known as the most
high-profile Vietnamese interpreter. With her strong background in linguistics and
what her colleagues have referred to as her interpreting / translating talent, she has
made a very good impression on legal and medical practitioners, politicians (e.g. a
Prime Minister, Ministers, Members of Parliament, community leaders, etc.),
delegates, businessmen, VIPs, TV audiences, etc. with her consecutive /
simultaneous interpreting skills at the courts, in high-level conferences /
workshops as well as on live TV. In her interpreting / translating career, not a
single client is less than happy with her work.</p>
<p> As a teacher, Dr Tran has four years of experience teaching English (TESOL) as a
staff member in the Department of English Linguistics and Literature, School of
Social Sciences and Humanities at Vietnam National University, and several periods
of teaching English as a Second Language (ESL) / tutoring in Linguistics and Applied
Linguistics in Vietnam, the U.S. and Australia. She has been teaching postgraduate
interpreting and translation as well as supervising MA theses in TESOL at the School
of Humanities and Communication Arts, Western Sydney University. Her creative
teaching and effective supervision have been highly complimented upon by her students and her colleagues.</p>
<p> As a researcher, Dr Tran has a number of publications and presentations (See details
under <a href="../pages/research.html">Research</a>). She has presented a workshop about Court Interpreting at AUSIT, where she was
praised for her expertise. Her article on court interpreting
in the Australian Law Society Journal (LSJ, April 2018, Issue 43) has also attracted
very positive feedback. She was also invited to present about Court Interpreting on Bench TV.</p>
