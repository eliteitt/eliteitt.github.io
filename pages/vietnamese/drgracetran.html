        <h1>Tiến sĩ Trần Quỳnh Giao (Dr Grace Tran)</h1>
        <h3> Founder<br>
        Principal Interpreter, Translator &amp; Teacher</h3>
        <p>Dr Tran has a PhD in Applied Linguistics from the University of Melbourne, an MA
in English (Applied Linguistics) and a Graduate Certificate in Teaching English to
Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) from University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI,
USA, a Graduate Diploma in TESOL from Canberra University and a BA in English
from Vietnam National University. She is also a NAATI Professional Interpreter and Translator in English and Vietnamese, both directions.</p>
    <p> As a professional interpreter and translator, Dr Tran is a trusted name in legal, (legal) medical, political and community interpreting and translation as well as in simultaneous / conference interpreting. With more than twenty five years of experience in interpreting and translating in Vietnam, USA, and Australia including the last fifteen years of experience as a Professional Interpreter and Translator in English and Vietnamese, both directions, in Australia, together with her strong academic background in Applied Linguistics, she has been known as the most high-profile Vietnamese interpreter and translator. She has received delightful compliments from legal and medical practitioners, politicians (e.g. a Prime Minister, Ministers, Members of Parliament, community leaders, etc.), delegates, directors, VIPs, businessmen, TV audiences, her colleagues, her clients, etc. on her consecutive and simultaneous interpreting skills in court, at high-level conferences and workshops as well as on live TV. In her interpreting and translating career, not a single client is less than happy with her work.</p>
    <p>As a professional teacher, Dr Tran has complete confidence in her teaching capacity with more than a decade of teaching experience. She has been able to deliver quality education and create a supportive environment for her students. Following four years of experience teaching English (TESOL) as a staff member in the Department of English Linguistics and Literature, School of Social Sciences and Humanities at Vietnam National University, and several periods of teaching English as a Second Language (ESL) as well as tutoring in postgraduate Linguistics and Applied Linguistics programs in Vietnam, USA and Australia, she has taught postgraduate interpreting and translation, and has supervised MA theses in TESOL at the School of Humanities and Communication Arts, Western Sydney University. Her teaching has been highly evaluated by her colleagues and prominently by her students.</p>
<p>As a career researcher, Dr Tran has a track record of peer-reviewed publications and presentations (See details under <a href="research.html" target="_blank">Research</a>). With her Naturalized Role-play - an original methodology that she created for her <a href="https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/3885126?lookfor=giao%20quynh%20tran&offset=1&max=1" target="_blank">PhD research</a>, she became one of the three researchers worldwide to win the Solidarity Award from the American Association for Applied Linguistics (AAAL) at the 2004 AAAL Conference. In 2017, her <a href = "http://ausit.org/AUSIT/Eflash/170610_Court_Interpreting_Workshop.html" target="_blank">Court Interpreting workshop at AUSIT</a> attracted great reviews. Her <a href="https://lsj.com.au/articles/interpreters-and-lawyers-why-we-must-work-together-for-better-outcomes/" target="_blank">article on court interpreting</a> in the Australian Law Society Journal (LSJ, April 2018, Issue 43) was also well-received. She was then invited to give a <a href = "https://benchtv.com.au/presenter/dr-giao-quynh-tran-dr-grace-tran/" target="_blank">presentation on legal interpreting</a> on Bench TV (broadcast on 15 November 2018).</p>
